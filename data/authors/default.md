Hello, I'm **Eric deQuevedo**, or **Ric**. Welcome to my Notebook, where we study the Art of Science & Magick, the Science of Art & Magick, and the Magick that is in Art & Science.

I am the author of the [Robot Ric Series](https://www.robotric.org/).

And a Quantum Solutions Architect at [Quantum Cyber Solutions](https://www.quantumcybersolutions.com/), I drive the company's vision and strategy, focusing on the development and implementation of quantum-enhanced solutions across various industries. I lead a team of quantum computing experts, software engineers, and data scientists to deliver cutting-edge quantum solutions that address complex business challenges. Our work involves collaborating with leading research institutions and industry partners to advance the field of quantum computing and its practical applications. 🚀🎓

When I'm not immersed in the world of quantum computing, I find myself captivated by the profound interconnectedness and untapped potential of the human mind. I firmly believe that our consciousness holds the key to unlocking extraordinary possibilities and shaping the future of technology. Just as quantum entanglement demonstrates the deep connections between seemingly disparate particles, I see the human mind as a vast network of interconnected thoughts and ideas, waiting to be explored and harnessed for the greater good. 🧠✨

I'm always eager to connect with like-minded professionals who share my passion for the intersection of quantum computing and the boundless creativity of the human mind. Whether it's discussing emerging trends in quantum technologies, delving into the philosophical implications of consciousness, or exploring new opportunities for collaboration, I'm ready to embark on thought-provoking conversations that push the boundaries of our understanding. 💡🗣️
