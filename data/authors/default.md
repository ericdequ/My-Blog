Hello, I'm **Eric deQuevedo**, a _Solutions Architect_ at **Emerging Tech**, bringing technical expertise in JavaScript, Python, and Go along with my ardor for unraveling intricate problems. I thrive in bridging the gap between technical and business teams, orchestrating optimal solutions that truly make an impact. My compelling communication and collaboration skills amplify my proficiency in driving secure, team-oriented results. 💡🌐

My work at Emerging Tech revolves around negotiating work shares, providing technical leadership to capture/proposal teams, leading to multiple successful teaming agreements. I've developed software managing contracts through their procurement lifecycle and integrated USA-spending database into our existing procurement software for unique data analysis and custom data queries. I am also a keen researcher, with recent work delving into the rising threat of cyber attacks in healthcare, a finding I've presented to the company's senior members to help inform our cybersecurity strategy.

On a lighter note, I indulge in soccer during my downtime and appreciate the fascinating world of AI-generated art. I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to grow as a professional, facing new challenges head-on. Feel free to connect with me to discuss anything tech, soccer, or AI art. 🚀🎨⚽
