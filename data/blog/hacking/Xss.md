## What are XSS Attacks?

💻 Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability that allows an
attacker to inject malicious code into a web page. This malicious code can then
steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, hijack accounts,
deface websites, or redirect users to malicious websites.

## Types of XSS Attacks

There are two main types of XSS attacks:

- 💣 **Reflected XSS attacks.** In a reflected XSS attack, the malicious code is
  injected into the response to a user-supplied request. For example, if a user
  enters their name into a form on a website, the attacker could inject
  malicious code into the response that would then be executed by the user's
  browser.
- 💻 **Stored XSS attacks.** In a stored XSS attack, the malicious code is
  stored on the website itself. This can happen if a website accepts
  user-submitted content that is not properly sanitized before being displayed
  on the website.

## Best Practices for Preventing XSS Attacks

🔒 To prevent XSS attacks, follow these best practices:

- 🧼 Sanitize all user-supplied input before it is displayed on the website by
  using a HTML parser or escaping special characters.
- 🛡️ Use a web application firewall (WAF) to filter out malicious traffic.
- 💻 Keep web applications up to date with the latest security patches.
- 📚 Educate users about the dangers of XSS attacks and how to protect
  themselves.

## Additional Tips for Preventing XSS Attacks

Here are some additional tips for preventing XSS attacks:

- 💻 Use a content management system (CMS) with built-in XSS protection.
- 📊 Use a web development framework with built-in XSS protection.
- 🛡️ Use a secure coding standard when developing web applications.
- 🔍 Conduct regular security audits of your web applications.
- 🕵️ Monitor your web applications for signs of XSS attacks.

## Conclusion

💻 XSS attacks are a serious security threat, but they can be prevented by
following best practices and additional tips. By taking steps to protect your
website from XSS attacks, you can help keep your users safe and secure. 🔒
