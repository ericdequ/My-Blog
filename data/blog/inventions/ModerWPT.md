## 🌟 Exploring Wireless Power Transmission: From Tesla's Vision to Modern Applications

Wireless Power Transmission (WPT) has captured the imagination of scientists and innovators for over a century. Originally envisioned by Nikola Tesla, WPT promises a future where energy can be transmitted without wires, leading to more sustainable and flexible power solutions. This blog post explores the invention, issues, capabilities, and key technologies of WPT, and how it integrates into the broader tech stack.

## ⚡ The Invention of Wireless Power Transmission

### Nikola Tesla's Vision

Nikola Tesla, a pioneering inventor, and electrical engineer, introduced the concept of wireless power transmission in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His dream was to create a system that could transmit electricity through the air, eliminating the need for wires and enabling sustainable energy solutions. Tesla's work laid the foundation for modern wireless power technologies, although his vision was not fully realized in his lifetime.

## 🚨 Issues with Wireless Power Transmission

While WPT holds great promise, several challenges must be addressed to make it a viable solution for widespread use.
