## 🌟 DIY Summer Dinghy Project: Build Your Own Floating Deck!

As summer approaches, it's the perfect time to embark on a fun and rewarding DIY project. Building your own summer dinghy offers endless possibilities for adventure on the water. This guide provides all the details you need to construct a floating deck, complete with flotation barrels, decking, and an engine. Let's dive into the project!

## 🛠️ Flotation

### Choosing Your Barrels

Flotation is key to keeping your dinghy afloat. You have a couple of options for barrels:

1. **55-Gallon Drums**
   - **Height**: 33 inches
   - **Diameter**: 23 inches
   - **Water Displacement**: 459 lbs per drum (lake water is denser)
   - **Steel Drum**: Weighs 48 lbs -> 411 lbs of buoyant force per barrel
   - **Plastic Drum**: Weighs 22 lbs -> 437 lbs of buoyant force per barrel

### Deciding on the Number of Barrels

The number of barrels you need will depend on the total weight of your dinghy, including passengers and gear. Here's a basic formula to help you decide:

{Number of Barrels} = (Total Weight)\(Buoyant Force per Barrel)

### Where to Get Barrels

- **Local Suppliers**: Check with local industrial suppliers or recycling centers.
- **Online Options**: Websites like Craigslist or specialized barrel suppliers.
- **DIY Option**: If you have the skills and materials, consider welding your own steel barrels.

## 🪵 Deck

### Deck Dimensions

Decide on the dimensions of your floating deck:

- **Length**: 10 ft
- **Width**: 6 ft

### Type of Wood and Sealing

- **Wood Type**: Choose a durable, water-resistant wood like cedar or treated pine.
- **Sealing**: Use a high-quality marine sealant to protect the wood from water damage.

### Deck Covering

- **Turf**: Add a layer of artificial turf for comfort and aesthetics.
  - **Size**: 6 ft x 8 ft
  - **Cost**: $27 from Walmart

This leaves an additional 2 ft for the motor mount.

## 🔩 Frame

### Building the Frame

The frame will support the barrels and deck:

- **Metal Frame**: Durable and strong, ideal for long-term use.
- **Wood Frame**: Easier to construct and more affordable, but less durable than metal.

### Frame Height

Ensure the frame extends at least 2 ft below the deck to hold the barrels securely.

## ⚙️ Engine Options

### Trolling Motor

- **No License Required**: For motors under 6 HP.
- **New**: Available on Amazon for $109.

### 2-Stroke Engine

- **Budget Option**: LEASTC 2-Stroke engine available for $80 with free shipping.

## 📝 Additional Considerations

### Number of Barrels

Ensure you calculate the correct number of barrels needed to support the total weight of your dinghy, passengers, and any additional gear.

### Barrel Sourcing

Determine where you'll source your barrels and whether you'll opt for steel or plastic based on weight and buoyancy needs.

### Construction Materials

Decide on the materials for the frame and deck based on durability, cost, and ease of construction.

### Engine Choice

Choose between a trolling motor or a 2-stroke engine based on your budget and licensing requirements.
