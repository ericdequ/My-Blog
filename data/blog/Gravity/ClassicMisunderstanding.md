## What is Gravity ?

Do you know scientist still have not proved gravity?

It seems like such a basic concept and we have quantified its effects but do we really understand it?

Is the term gravity a case of Classical Misunderstanding (pun intended)!

## Is there a better Explanation?

Did you know that You can use the inverse of Classical Newtonian physics to prove quantum mechanics?

For this example lets imagine a ball rolling down a hill ...

Newton would say you add up all the vectors acting on it ( gravity pointing to earths center ) ... and and rocks, or divots that it hits while going down until the forces balance out and the ball stops moving... Thanks friction

Richard Feynman proved that there is another way to calculate a ball rolling down a hill ...

He said the ball could have freedom of choice where to go but the ball choses the path of least resistance, because the ball has no will to go anywhere else.

This may seem trivial but layed the ground work for simulating quantum mechanics by using a ton of integrals and picking the path of least resistance.

## How does this relate to gravity?

So just as Newtons
