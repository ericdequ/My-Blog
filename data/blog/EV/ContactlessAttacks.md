## 🌟 Can You Trust Autonomous Vehicles: Contactless Attacks Against Sensors of Self-driving Vehicles

As autonomous vehicles become increasingly prevalent, ensuring their safety and trustworthiness is paramount. This blog post delves into the security of autonomous vehicle sensors, highlighting potential vulnerabilities and proposing solutions to enhance their resilience. Our research investigates contactless attacks against key sensors and evaluates their impact on the functionality of self-driving cars.

## 📚 Abstract

### Context

To improve road safety and driving experiences, autonomous vehicles have emerged as a promising technology. However, before they can be widely adopted, the trustworthiness of these vehicles must be thoroughly examined.

### Research Problem

Despite their advanced safety features, the sensors that guide autonomous vehicles—such as millimeter-wave radars, ultrasonic sensors, and forward-looking cameras—are susceptible to various attacks. This study examines the security of these sensors and investigates their trustworthiness.

### Study Design

Our work focuses on sensors used to guide autonomous vehicles, specifically investigating millimeter-wave radars, ultrasonic sensors, and forward-looking cameras.

### Major Findings

Using off-the-shelf hardware, we were able to perform jamming and spoofing attacks, causing the Tesla’s sensors to malfunction or become "blind."

### Solutions and Conclusions

To mitigate these issues, we propose both software and hardware countermeasures designed to improve sensor resilience against these attacks.

## 🔍 Introduction

### Present the Topic and Context

Autonomous vehicles promise to revolutionize road safety and driving experiences. However, the security and reliability of the sensors guiding these vehicles need thorough examination to ensure widespread adoption.

### Research Gap

While there has been significant progress in autonomous vehicle technology, there is a research gap concerning the vulnerabilities of their sensors to external attacks.

### Purpose of the Study

Our study aims to investigate the security of autonomous vehicle sensors, identify potential vulnerabilities, and propose solutions to enhance their resilience.

### Methodology and Approach

We conducted experiments on millimeter-wave radars, ultrasonic sensors, and forward-looking cameras to assess their susceptibility to jamming and spoofing attacks.

### Findings and Potential Solutions

We demonstrated that these sensors could be compromised using readily available hardware. We propose a combination of software and hardware countermeasures to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

## 🔧 Background

Autonomous vehicles rely on a variety of sensors to navigate and make decisions. Understanding these sensors and their vulnerabilities is crucial for enhancing their security and reliability.

## 📖 Related Work

Previous studies have explored the security of IoT devices and automotive systems. Our research builds on this foundation by specifically targeting the sensors of autonomous vehicles and identifying unique vulnerabilities.

## 🚨 Threat Model

### Description of the Threat

We identified several threat vectors, including jamming and spoofing attacks, that can compromise the functionality of autonomous vehicle sensors.

### Attacker Objectives and Capabilities

Attackers aim to disrupt sensor readings, causing the vehicle to malfunction or misinterpret its surroundings.

### Assumptions and Limitations

Our threat model assumes attackers have access to basic hardware tools and can operate within the vicinity of the target vehicle.

### Potential Impact

Compromised sensors can lead to incorrect decisions by the autonomous vehicle, potentially causing accidents or operational failures.

## 🔍 Evaluation

### Research Questions and Metrics

We evaluated the sensors' vulnerability to various attacks, using established metrics to compare results and assess the impact on sensor performance.

### Methodology

Our evaluation included detailed experiments on ultrasonic sensors, millimeter-wave radars, and forward-looking cameras.

### Results

We found that a significant percentage of sensors could be compromised through jamming and spoofing, leading to incorrect measurements and potential system failures.

## 🛠️ Methodology

### Ultrasonic Sensors

Used for parking guidance and blind spot detection, these sensors were subjected to jamming and spoofing attacks to assess their vulnerability.

### Millimeter-wave Radars

Commonly used for collision avoidance and adaptive cruise control, these radars were also tested for susceptibility to interference.

### Forward-looking Cameras

Critical for object detection and lane-keeping, these cameras were evaluated for their resistance to jamming.

## 📝 Discussion

### Interpretations

Our findings highlight the need for robust security measures to protect autonomous vehicle sensors from external attacks.

### Implications

Ensuring sensor reliability is crucial for the safe deployment of autonomous vehicles on public roads.

### Limitations

Our study focused on a specific set of sensors and attack vectors; further research is needed to explore additional vulnerabilities.

### Recommendations

We recommend implementing both software and hardware countermeasures to enhance sensor resilience.

## 🏁 Conclusion & Future Work

### Outcome of the Work

Our research demonstrates the vulnerability of autonomous vehicle sensors to contactless attacks and highlights the need for improved security measures.

### Future Directions

Future research should explore additional sensors and attack vectors, and develop more comprehensive security solutions to protect autonomous vehicles.
