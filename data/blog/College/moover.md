# 🚚 Moover: Turn Any Truck into a Buck—The Campus Moving App Gainesville Needs

We’ve all been there:

- You just found a free couch on Facebook Marketplace—but no way to move it.  
- You’re moving apartments (again), sweating through the lease cycle—and your friend with a truck won’t text back.  
- You bought a new TV, but UberXL won’t cut it—and you don’t want to rent a whole U-Haul.

**Introducing Moover**—the Uber-style app for **college towns, moving madness, and everyday hauls**, powered by local truck owners looking to make some easy money.

## 🎯 The Problem: Gainesville’s Annual Moving Spiral

In Gainesville (and college towns everywhere), **August is chaos**:

- Tens of thousands of students **swap leases, upgrade rooms, or flee bad landlords**  
- Traffic swells with box trucks, last-minute U-Hauls, and borrowed SUVs  
- Students have **stuff to move—but no gear, no helpers, and no time**

Meanwhile? **Trucks are sitting in driveways**, unused, under-leveraged, full of torque and potential.

That’s the gap. **Moover fills it.**
