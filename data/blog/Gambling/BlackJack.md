# Winning Strategies for Blackjack 🃏♠️♥️♦️♣️

Blackjack is a popular casino card game where the objective is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without exceeding 21. There are various strategies to enhance your chances of winning at blackjack. One crucial strategy is to play by the book, which means adhering to a set of statistically advantageous rules. Several books can teach you how to play blackjack by the book.

## Specific Cases 📚🎲

Here are some specific cases where playing by the book can be beneficial:

- **When the dealer's upcard is a 10 or an Ace**: In this scenario, it is generally better to stand, regardless of your hand. The dealer has a high likelihood of busting, and you don't want to risk going over 21. 🚫✋
- **When the dealer's upcard is a 2, 3, 4, or 5**: In this situation, it is typically better to hit, regardless of your hand. The dealer has a low chance of busting, and you want to maximize your odds of having a hand closer to 21 than the dealer's hand. ⬆️✅
- **When you have a blackjack**: In this case, you should always stand because blackjack is the best possible hand, and you don't want to risk losing it by taking another card. 💯🥇

## Basic Strategy Chart 📊

The following chart provides a detailed guide on when to hit, stay, split, or double down based on your cards and the dealer's upcard:

| Your Hand               | Dealer's Upcard (2-10, A)                                   |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |

| 10-10                   | Always stand                                                |

## Running Count 🏃‍♂️🔢

Another essential blackjack strategy is using a running count. A running count tracks the number of high and low cards played in the deck, helping you make more informed decisions about hitting or standing. To calculate a running count, start with a count of zero. Add 1 to the count every time a high card (10, Jack, Queen, King, or Ace) is played, and subtract 1 from the count every time a low card (2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) is played. ➕➖

You can use the running count to make better decisions about hitting or standing. For example, if the running count is positive, there are more high cards in the deck than low cards. This increases your chances of getting a blackjack if you hit, so you should hit more frequently. 📈🃏

Here's how a running count can affect your decision-making based on the basic strategy chart:

- If the running count is +2 or higher, you should stand on 12 against a dealer's 2 or 3 (instead of hitting).
- If the running count is +3 or higher, you should double down on 9 against a dealer's 2 (instead of hitting).
- If the running count is +4 or higher, you should double down on soft 19 against a dealer's 6 (instead of standing).

Remember, the running count becomes more accurate as more cards are played, so it's essential to keep track throughout the entire game.

## Tricks to Remember Basic Strategy 🧠✨

Memorizing the basic strategy chart can seem daunting, but there are some tricks to help you remember:

1. **Always split aces and 8s**: This is one of the most important rules to remember, as it can significantly improve your chances of winning. 🆎8️⃣
2. **Never split 5s or 10s**: Splitting 5s reduces your chances of getting a strong hand, while splitting 10s reduces your chances of getting a winning hand. 5️⃣🔟
3. **Double down on 11**: Whenever you have a hand totaling 11, you should double down, as this gives you a high chance of getting a winning hand without going bust. 1️⃣1️⃣
4. **Use a mnemonic device**: Create a memorable phrase or acronym to help you remember specific rules, such as "Always Stay on 17" (AS17) or "Never Bust with 12 Against 2 or 3" (NB123). 🎭🔠

## Leveraging a Running Count to Win Big 💰🏆

By maintaining a running count and using it to make informed decisions about hitting or standing, you can gain a significant advantage over the casino. Some experts estimate that a skilled blackjack player can have an edge of up to 1% over the casino. 🎓🎰

However, it's essential to practice your skills and strategies before attempting to use a running count in a real casino. Many casinos frown upon card counting and may ask you to leave if they suspect you of using this technique. 👀🚫
