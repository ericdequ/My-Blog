## How to Play 5 Card Poker: Master the Classic Card Game 🃏♠️♥️♦️♣️

5 card poker is a classic card game that is easy to learn and fun to play. It can be played with any number of players, and it is a great game for beginners and experienced players alike.

## Basic Rules of 5 Card Poker 📜🕹️

To play 5 card poker, you will need a standard 52-card deck. The cards are ranked from 2 to Ace, with Ace being the highest card.

The game is played in rounds, and each round begins with the dealer dealing 5 cards to each player. The dealer then turns over one card face up, which is called the "flop." 🔄🃏

After the flop, players have the option to "bet," "check," or "fold." Betting is when you put money into the pot. Checking is when you do not bet, but you also do not fold. Folding is when you give up on your hand and forfeit your money. 💸🤔

Once all players have acted, the dealer turns over another card face up, called the "turn." Players then have another opportunity to bet, check, or fold. ↩️🎲

Finally, the dealer turns over the last card face up, called the "river." Players then have one last chance to bet, check, or fold. 🔄🏁

After the river, the player with the best hand wins the pot. The best hand is determined by the following ranking:

1. Royal flush (Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and 10 of the same suit) 👑🎉
2. Straight flush (5 consecutive cards of the same suit) 🌟✨
3. Four of a kind (4 of the same rank) 🔥🔥
4. Full house (3 of a kind and a pair) 🏠🎊
5. Flush (5 cards of the same suit) 💧🌊
6. Straight (5 consecutive cards of any suit) ➡️🔝
7. Three of a kind 🎯🎯
8. Two pair 👥👥
9. One pair 👫
10. High card (the highest card in your hand) 🚀

If two players have the same hand, the pot is split evenly between them. 🤝💰
