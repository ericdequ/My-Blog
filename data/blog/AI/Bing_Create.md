## How to Use Bing Create to Make AI Images üé®

Bing Create is a new tool from Microsoft that allows you to create AI images from text descriptions. It is powered by OpenAI's DALL-E 2, which is one of the most powerful AI image generators available today.

To use Bing Create, you will need to have a Microsoft account and a browser. You can then go to the Bing Create website and sign in. Once you are signed in, you can start creating AI images by entering a text description into the prompt box.

The prompt box is a simple text field where you can enter a description of the image you want to create. You can use any text you want, but it is important to be as specific as possible. For example, if you want to create an image of a cat sitting on a chair, you would enter something like "a cat sitting on a chair in a living room." üêà

Once you have entered a prompt, click the "Create" button. Bing Create will then generate a few different AI images based on your prompt. You can then select the image you like best and download it to your computer.
