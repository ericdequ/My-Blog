## üìö Introduction

Manim, short for Mathematical Animation Engine, is a powerful Python library that allows you to create stunning animations and visualizations of mathematical concepts. Created by Grant Sanderson, the mind behind the popular YouTube channel 3Blue1Brown, Manim has gained a dedicated following among educators, researchers, and math enthusiasts.

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of setting up Manim and creating your first animation. Whether you're a seasoned Python developer or a beginner looking to explore the world of mathematical visualization, this guide will provide you with the foundation you need to get started with Manim.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up Manim

Before we dive into creating animations, let's make sure you have Manim properly set up on your system. Follow these steps to install Manim:

1. **Install Python**: Manim requires Python 3.7 or later. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Install Manim**: Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install Manim using pip:

   ```
   pip install manim
   ```

   This will install the latest version of Manim along with its dependencies.

3. **Verify the Installation**: To ensure that Manim is installed correctly, run the following command:

   ```
   manim --version
   ```

   If Manim is installed properly, you should see the version number printed in the terminal.

## üé¨ Creating Your First Animation

Now that you have Manim set up, let's create a simple animation to get a feel for how it works. We'll create an animation that showcases the creation of a circle and a square.

1. **Create a New Python File**: Open your favorite text editor and create a new file. Save it with a `.py` extension, for example, `first_animation.py`.

2. **Import Manim**: At the top of your Python file, import the necessary Manim classes:

   ```python
   from manim import *
   ```

3. **Define the Animation Class**: Create a new class that inherits from `Scene`, which is the base class for creating animations in Manim:

   ```python
   class FirstAnimation(Scene):
       def construct(self):
           # Animation code goes here
   ```

   The `construct` method is where you'll define the animation sequence.

4. **Create Shapes**: Inside the `construct` method, create a circle and a square using Manim's built-in shape classes:

   ```python
   circle = Circle()
   square = Square()
   ```

5. **Position the Shapes**: Set the positions of the circle and square using the `next_to` method:

   ```python
   square.next_to(circle, RIGHT)
   ```

   This will position the square to the right of the circle.

6. **Animate the Shapes**: Use the `create` method to animate the creation of the shapes:

   ```python
   self.play(Create(circle), Create(square))
   ```

   The `play` method is used to animate objects on the screen.

7. **Save and Run the Animation**: Save your Python file and run the following command in the terminal, replacing `first_animation.py` with the name of your file:

   ```
   manim first_animation.py FirstAnimation -p
   ```

   This command will render the animation and open it in a video player.

Congratulations! You've just created your first animation using Manim. You should see a circle and a square appearing on the screen.

## üé® Customizing Your Animation

Manim provides a wide range of options for customizing your animations. Here are a few examples:

- **Changing Colors**: You can change the color of shapes using the `color` parameter:

  ```python
  circle = Circle(color=RED)
  square = Square(color=BLUE)
  ```

- **Adding Text**: You can add text to your animation using the `Text` class:

  ```python
  text = Text("Hello, Manim!")
  self.play(Write(text))
  ```

- **Animating Transformations**: Manim allows you to animate transformations between shapes using the `Transform` class:

  ```python
  self.play(Transform(circle, square))
  ```

  This will animate the transformation of the circle into a square.
