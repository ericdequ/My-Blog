**Reflections on Perception and Reality**

- "We confuse science, words, numbers, and ideas with the real world." — **Alan Watts**

  I believe this quote aptly captures the state of our society. So engrossed are we in our thoughts that we've become disconnected from our senses. If we await evidence for everything before accepting its existence, then we limit ourselves to what our tools can measure, instead of acknowledging the vastness of reality.

- "There's no miracle people; they got interested in this thing and learned all this stuff. There are just people, there's no talent, miracle, ability to understand quantum mechanics, to understand an electromagnetic field." — **Richard Feynman**

  Quantum mechanics and universal consciousness are accessible to all. These insights aren't limited to physicists with degrees. Many quantum theories mirror what spiritualists have been saying for millennia.

**Limitations of the Scientific Model**

- I'm not claiming the scientific model is flawed, but its rigorous demand for proof may limit groundbreaking ideas from emerging.

- How many revolutionary ideas have vanished with their thinkers simply because they couldn't translate them into mathematical formulas?

- This is like saying that bees cant fly because we do not understand how they do it?
  - but we all know they can fly?

**Einstein vs. Tesla**

- Einstein used complex equations to validate his concepts. But what tangible creations resulted from his efforts?

  In contrast, Nikola Tesla proved his genius through his inventions:

  - **Alternating Current (AC) Electrical System**
  - **Tesla Coil**
  - **Rotating Magnetic Field**
  - **Induction Motor**
  - And many more...

**Understanding Quantum Mechanics**

- While quantum mechanics deals with the minute, it doesn't mean we should ignore the bigger picture.
- We often forget the ancient concept of 'As Above, So Below', implying that macrocosmic events mirror microcosmic ones.

**Personal Reflections on Consciousness and Computers**

- Drawing from my experience in computer science, I liken human consciousness to a component displaying data from a central source. We might be mere conduits for universal data.

- Quantum mechanics reveals phenomena, like entangled particles transmitting information faster than light, defying classical physics. I believe this doesn't just occur at the subatomic level. If we embraced the 'As Above, So Below' philosophy, it could reshape our understanding of reality.

**Contemplation on Modern Science**

- Science, as it stands, might be limited by ego and established systems.
- Einstein, akin to a scientific messiah, did provide profound insights. But was everything he proposed accurate?

**The Need for a New Perspective**

- If we dared to embrace things beyond provable realms, admit our ignorance, and discard preconceived notions, we could potentially unlock a deeper understanding of the universe.
- In cybersecurity, there's a shift from 'Trust but Verify' to 'Zero Trust'. Similarly, in understanding our world, we should re-evaluate established knowledge and be open to fresh perspectives.
