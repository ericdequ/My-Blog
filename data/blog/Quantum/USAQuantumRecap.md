# Quantum Leap in the USA: 2023 Quantum Initiatives

In 2023, the United States government made significant strides in its quantum initiatives, as part of the National Quantum Initiative (NQI) and the National Quantum Coordination Office (NQCO). With a focus on quantum computing and cryptography, the USA has been working to maintain its global leadership in this rapidly advancing field.

## Key Aspects of the USA's Quantum Initiatives

One of the key aspects of the USA's quantum initiatives is the emphasis on collaboration and partnerships. The government has been working closely with industry, academia, and international partners to drive innovation and ensure that the USA remains at the forefront of quantum technology. This collaborative approach has led to numerous breakthroughs in quantum computing and cryptography, as well as the development of new educational and workforce development programs.

## Investment in Research and Development

In addition to the focus on collaboration, the USA has also been investing heavily in quantum research and development. In 2023, the government allocated significant funding for quantum initiatives, including the establishment of new research centers and the expansion of existing facilities. This investment has allowed the USA to make significant progress in areas such as quantum sensing, quantum communication, and quantum simulation.

## Budget Expenditures and National Laboratories

According to a report by The Quantum Insider published in January of this year, the budget expenditures for QIS R&D increased from $449 million in 2019 to $918 million in 2022 , and requested budget authority of $844 million for 2023. This substantial and sustained investment in QIS R&D highlights the USA's commitment to accelerating its leadership in this field.

Furthermore, the government has established several national laboratories whose sole focus is targeted at quantum computing research. These include:

- Argonne National Laboratory, whose CELS Directorate is pursuing research in quantum information science that spans theory, algorithms, simulations, and modeling of quantum systems.
- Brookhaven National Laboratory, which is developing advanced quantum computing and communication technologies.
- Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, which is working on a wide range of quantum information science research projects.

In line with these efforts, the U.S. policymakers released the [National Quantum Initiative (NQI) Supplement](https://www.quantum.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2018_NSTC_National_Strategic_Overview_QIS.pdf) to the President's FY 2024 Budget, marking 2024 as a critical year for the NQI program. The comprehensive report recognizes the combined efforts of multiple federal agencies, including NIST, NSF, DOE, DOD, NASA, NSA, and IARPA. The NQI Advisory Committee also recommended the reauthorization of the NQI Act for at least another five years to maintain US leadership in quantum technology ([The Quantum Insider](https://thequantuminsider.com)).

Significant achievements have been highlighted, such as the development of a new approach to quantum error mitigation at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and the advancements made in using neutral atoms as qubits. These efforts showcase the USA's strategic approach to maintaining global leadership in quantum computing ([HPCwire](https://www.hpcwire.com)).
