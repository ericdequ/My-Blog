# Understanding RAID Levels

RAID redundant array of independent disks is a technology that combines
multiple hard disk drives HDDs into a single logical unit. RAID provides
several benefits over using a single HDD, including improved performance,
increased capacity, and improved fault tolerance.

In this guide, we will be discussing the different RAID levels, their advantages
and disadvantages, and help you determine which RAID level is right for you.

## RAID 1 (Mirroring)

RAID 1 involves creating an exact copy of all data on two or more HDDs. This
provides the highest level of fault tolerance, as if one HDD fails, the data can
be recovered from the other HDD. However, RAID 1 has the lowest capacity
utilization, as all data is duplicated.

## RAID 5 (Striping with Parity)

RAID 5 divides data into blocks and stores each block on a different HDD. A
parity bit is also stored on each HDD, which can be used to reconstruct the data
if one HDD fails. RAID 5 provides good fault tolerance and capacity utilization,
but it is not as reliable as RAID 1.

## RAID 6 (Striping with Double Parity)

RAID 6 is similar to RAID 5, but it uses two parity bits per block. This
provides even better fault tolerance than RAID 5, but it also has a lower
capacity utilization.

## RAID 10 (Mirroring and Striping)

RAID 10 is a combination of RAID 1 and RAID 0. It involves creating an exact
copy of each block of data on two HDDs, and the blocks are then striped across
the HDDs. RAID 10 provides the highest level of fault tolerance and capacity
utilization of any RAID level, but it is also the most expensive.

## Choosing the Right RAID Level

The best RAID level for you will depend on your specific needs. If you need the
highest level of fault tolerance, RAID 1 is the best choice. If you need a good
balance of fault tolerance and capacity utilization, RAID 5 or RAID 6 is a good
choice. If you need the highest capacity utilization, RAID 10 is the best
choice.

Remember, no RAID level is 100% reliable. It is always important to have a
backup plan in place for critical data.
