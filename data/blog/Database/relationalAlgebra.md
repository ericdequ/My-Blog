Sure. Relational algebra is a formal theory that deals with the manipulation of relations. A relation is a mathematical object that can be thought of as a table of data. Relational algebra is based on the idea of operators, which are functions that take relations as input and produce relations as output. There are a number of different operators in relational algebra, each of which performs a different operation on a relation.

Some of the most common relational algebra operators include:

* **Select** The select operator is used to select rows from a relation that satisfy a given condition. For example, the following select statement would select all rows from the `employees` relation where the `salary` is greater than 100000:
```
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 100000;
```

* **Project** The project operator is used to project columns from a relation. For example, the following project statement would project the `name` and `salary` columns from the `employees` relation:
```
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees;
```

* **Join** The join operator is used to combine two relations based on a common column. For example, the following join statement would combine the `employees` and `departments` relations based on the `department_id` column:
```
SELECT *
FROM employees
JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

* **Union** The union operator is used to combine two relations into a single relation. For example, the following union statement would combine the `employees` and `managers` relations:
```
SELECT *
FROM employees
UNION
SELECT *
FROM managers;
```

* **Intersection** The intersection operator is used to find the rows that are common to two relations. For example, the following intersection statement would find the rows that are common to the `employees` and `managers` relations:
```
SELECT *
FROM employees
INTERSECT
SELECT *
FROM managers;
```

* **Difference** The difference operator is used to find the rows that are in one relation but not in another. For example, the following difference statement would find the rows that are in the `employees` relation but not in the `managers` relation:
```
SELECT *
FROM employees
EXCEPT
SELECT *
FROM managers;
```

Relational algebra is a powerful tool for manipulating relations. It can be used to perform a wide variety of operations on data, including selecting, projecting, joining, unioning, intersecting, and differencing. Relational algebra is a fundamental part of database theory and is used in many database systems.
